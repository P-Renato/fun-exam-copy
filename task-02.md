## Questions

- Question 1: What is the difference between a HDD and SSD?
    1. Technology
        - HDDs use mechanical parts to read and write data.
        - SSDs use flash memory (NAND flash) with no moving parts to store data.
    2. Speed
        - HDDs are generally slower because of its mechanical parts.
        - SSDs are much faster than HDDs. They can access data almost instantly because they don’t rely on moving parts.
    3. Durability and Liability
        - HDD are more likely to get a mechanical failure because of moving parts. Drops, shocks, or physical damage can cause issues.
        - SDD are more durable because they have no moving parts, making them less susceptible to physical damage from drops or bumps.
    4. Power Consumption
        - HDDs consumes more power because the platters need to spin, and the read/write head has to move physically.
        - SDDs consumes less power, making them more efficient and ideal for laptops and mobile devices where battery life is important.
    5. Storage Capacity
        - HDDs offer larger capacities at a lower price point, often ranging from several hundred gigabytes to several terabytes.
        - Historically, SSDs have been more expensive for the same storage size, though prices have been dropping over time. SSDs typically offer less storage capacity at the same price compared to HDDs, but larger SSDs are available now.
    6. Noise and Heat
        - HDDs can produce more noise and also heat.
        - SDDs operate silently and produce less heat because there are no moving parts.
    7. Lifespan
        - HDDs typically last longer in terms of overall write cycles, but mechanical failure due to moving parts can happen over time.
        - While SSDs have a limited number of write cycles (each memory cell can only be written to a certain number of times), this limit is usually far beyond typical consumer usage. However, excessive writing to an SSD over long periods can degrade its performance.
    8. Cost
        - HDDs are typically cheaper per gigabyte of storage compared to SSDs, making them a cost-effective option for large storage needs.
        - Whereas SSds are more expensive per gigabyte, but the cost of SSDs has been decreasing as technology improves.
    9. Use cases:
        - HDDs are beter for storage-heavy tasks like archiving data, or for users who need a large amount of storage on a budget (e.g., desktop storage, backup drives).
        - Whereas SDDs are ideal for users who need high speed, such as for operating system boot drives, gaming, video editing, or other tasks requiring fast data access (e.g., laptops, ultrabooks, and high-performance PCs).

- Question 2: What is the purpose of RAM?
    - Its primary purpose is to provide fast, temporary storage for data that is actively being used or processed by the system. In other words, RAM plays an essential role in improving the performance and responsiveness of a system by providing high-speed temporary storage for data that is actively being processed. The more RAM you have, the better your system can handle multiple tasks simultaneously and run demanding applications without slowing down.

- Question 3: What does the IP `127.0.0.1` refer to?
    - The IP address `127.0.0.1`is a Loopback address ad it allows a device to send data to itself for internal communication and testing. It is commonly used for local testing, web development (localhost), and network diagnostics.

- Question 4: What is wrong with `8.45.260.61` as an IP address?
    - The IP address 8.45.260.61 is invalid because 260 is outside the valid range for an octet in an IPv4 address.
    
- Question 5: Give an example of an IPv6 address.
    - 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
        - This is a 128-bit address written in hexadecimal and divided into 8 groups, separated by colons (:).
        - Each group represents 16 bits (4 hexadecimal digits).

- Question 6: What is your current internal IP address?
    - 192.168.0.66
- Question 7: What is your current external IP address?
    - 2a02:8109:9dab:5600:8e07:e035:949a:2f54

- Question 8: What is the purpose of DNS?
    - It's purpose to make IP addresses into readable name for people, which is easier to memorize.

- Question 9: List 10 different top level domains
    1. com – Originally intended for commercial organizations, but now used globally by businesses, blogs, and personal websites.
    2. org – Typically used by non-profit organizations, but also adopted by many other types of websites.
    3. net – Initially intended for network providers and infrastructure-related sites, but now used by various entities.
    4. edu – Reserved for educational institutions, particularly universities and colleges in the United States.
    5. gov – Reserved for U.S. government entities and organizations.
    6. io – Originally the country code for the British Indian Ocean Territory, now popular with tech startups and projects.
    7. co – Originally the country code for Colombia, but now used by companies and startups as an alternative to .com.
    8. biz – Intended for businesses, especially small businesses, and commercial sites.
    9. tv – Originally for the country of Tuvalu, but widely used for websites related to television, media, and streaming.
    10. me – Originally the country code for Montenegro, but now often used for personal websites or branding (e.g., "yourname.me").

- Question 10: Give two examples of URLs with a subdomain
    - en.wikipedia.org
    - support.google.com
