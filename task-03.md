## Questions

- Question 1: What does "whitespace" refer to in design?
- Answer 1: It refers the **empty spaces** between the elements on a page. It normally improves readability and creats balance and harmony. But it also enhances the user experience and directs the user attention. We have as exemple of whitespace in design padding and margin, line spacing, paragraph spacing and gaps between elements.  

- Question 2: What is the difference between transparent and opaque?
- Answer 2: Transparent is when you can see through, and opaque you can not.

- Question 3: What kind of color is `#ff0000`?
- Answer 3: Logically thinking, it must be one of the primary colors, though I'm not sure which. So I think is either blue, green or red. 

- Question 4: What kind of color is `hsl(240, 100%, 80%)`?
- Answer 4: "h" refers to the hue value, "s" refers to the saturation, and "l" refers to the lightness. So 240 is a number that refers to the hue value, which in this case is blue.

- Question 5: What is kerning?
- Answer 5: **Kerning** refers to the spacing between characters in a word or a line of text. It is the **process of adjusting the space between specific pairs of letters** to create a more visually balanced and aesthetically pleasing appearance. The goal of kerning is to ensure that the letters are spaced in a way that makes the text easy to read and looks consistent.

- Question 6: What is the difference between vector and raster graphics?
- Answer 6: vector does not pixel it.

    - The difference between vector graphics and raster graphics primarily lies in how they represent images and how they handle scaling and detail.
    1. **Vector Graphics**

        - **Definition:** Vector graphics are created using mathematical equations to define geometric shapes such as lines, circles, and polygons.
        - **Components:** They are made up of points, lines, and curves defined by mathematical formulas.
        - **File Types:** Common vector file formats include .ai (Adobe Illustrator), .svg (Scalable Vector Graphics), .eps (Encapsulated PostScript), and .pdf (Portable Document Format).
        - **Characteristics:**
            - **Scalability:** Vector images can be resized infinitely without losing quality because they are based on formulas, not pixels.
            - **File Size:** Generally smaller file sizes compared to raster images, especially for simpler graphics.
            - **Editing:** Easier to edit, as you can manipulate individual elements like shapes, lines, and colors.
            - **Best for:** Logos, illustrations, technical drawings, and designs that need to be scaled (e.g., printed on both a business card and a billboard).

    2. **Raster Graphics**

        - **Definition:** Raster graphics, also called bitmap graphics, consist of a grid of individual pixels, each with its own color and brightness.
        - **Components:** Made up of a matrix of pixels (small squares of color), each pixel contributing to the final image.
        - **File Types:** Common raster file formats include .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, and .tiff.
        - **Characteristics:**
            - **Resolution-dependent:** Raster images lose quality when resized (especially if enlarged), as they are pixel-based. Enlarging a raster image results in a "pixelated" or blurry appearance.
            - **File Size:** Can have larger file sizes, particularly for high-resolution images.
            - **Editing:** Editing is pixel-based, making it more difficult to change individual components without affecting the whole image.
            - **Best for:** Photographs, detailed images, and artwork that relies on color gradients and textures.


- Question 7: What is the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
- Answer 7: The difference between lossy and lossless compression lies in how the data is reduced and whether any information is lost during the process. Here's a breakdown of each type:
    1. **Lossy Compression:**

        - **Definition:** Lossy compression reduces file size by permanently removing some data from the original file. The data that's discarded is often considered unnecessary or less noticeable to the human senses (e.g., certain audio frequencies or image details).
        - **File Quality:** As a result of the data removal, quality is sacrificed. While the difference may be barely noticeable in many cases, repeated compression or excessive compression can cause a degradation in quality.
        - **File Size:** Lossy compression results in smaller file sizes compared to lossless compression because it discards data to achieve a higher level of compression.
        - **Use Cases:** This type of compression is ideal for media files where a perfect reproduction isn't necessary, and file size reduction is more important.
        - **Common Formats:**
            - Audio: .mp3, .aac, .ogg
            - Images: .jpg, .jpeg, .webp
            - Video: .mp4, .avi, .mov

    2. **Lossless Compression:**

        - **Definition:** Lossless compression reduces file size without losing any data. It compresses files by finding and eliminating redundancy in the data, but no actual content is removed.
        - **File Quality:** The quality of the file is preserved exactly as it was originally, meaning that when the file is decompressed, it is identical to the original version.
        - **File Size:** Lossless compression typically results in larger file sizes than lossy compression because it doesnâ€™t discard any data.
        - **Use Cases:** Lossless compression is used when maintaining the exact quality of the file is critical, such as in professional images, documents, and some audio formats.
        - **Common Formats:**
            - Audio: .flac, .alac, .wav
            - Images: .png, .gif, .tiff
            - General Files: .zip, .rar, .gzip

- Question 8: What is the difference between a font and a typeface?
- Answer 8: The terms font and typeface are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between them, especially in the context of typography. Here's a breakdown:
    1. **Typeface:**

        - **Definition:** A typeface refers to the design or style of the letters, numbers, and symbols. It is the overall visual appearance or concept of a set of characters that share common features, such as the shape of the letters and the overall style.
        > **Examples:**
        >    Helvetica, Times New Roman, Arial, Garamond
        - **Description:** A typeface includes all the variations of a specific design, such as different weights (light, regular, bold), italics, and other styles. It's essentially the creative design or "family" of characters.

    2. **Font:**

        - **Definition:** A font refers to a specific instance or implementation of a typeface, which includes the specific size, weight, and style. In the digital world, a font can also refer to the file or software that contains the characters of a typeface in a particular style and size.
        > **Examples:**
        >    Helvetica Bold, Times New Roman Regular 12pt, Arial Italic 10pt
        - **Description:** The font defines how a particular typeface is displayed in a specific style, size, and weight. For instance, if you're using the Helvetica typeface, you might choose the Helvetica Regular 12pt font or Helvetica Bold 14pt font.

- Question 15: In the Assets panel, how many different templates are there in the Cards section?
- Answer 15: 74 components, which I belive this are the templates.
